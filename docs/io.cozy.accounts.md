# Cozy Accounts doctype

The `io.cozy.accounts` doctype stores authentification informations used by [konnectors](https://github.com/konnectors) to connect to external services or API.

Accounts can be managed in [Cozy-Collect](http://github.com/cozy/cozy-collect/). They are generally associated to a [`io.cozy.triggers`](io.cozy.triggers) document.

`io.cozy.accounts` attributes are:

- `account_type` (_deprecated_) : {string} Slug of the konnector the account is related to.
- `auth`: {object} Contains authentification data, typically a couple with `login`/`password`. It could also contain an attribute `token` for OAuth konnectors.
- `data`: {object} Additional custom data.
- `label`: {string} Label given by user.

### `auth`

The `auth` attribute may also contain other data, like  `accountName`, `folderPath` or `frequency`. As `auth` should only be used for authentication mechanisms, those two values should disappear soon.

* `folderPath` should purely and simply disappear, the folder information is stored in `io.cozy.trigger`.
* `accountName` is in reality the `label`, change should be made soon to fix this mistake.
* `frequency` should move at the root of the account.
* `namePath`: The name of the last folder. Usually saved along with `folderPath`.

The `auth` attributes also contain all values for the fields attribute specified in the `manifest.konnector` file.

## Relationships

### `parent`

An account may have a `parent` relationship. It is used to indicate that this accounts depends on another one.
Generally, the konnector should be able to handle by itself this kind of relationshiop, like querying the database to get the information it needs. A `parent` relationship is aimed to be an account overriden by the account it is linked to, but it can also be use as an _aggregator_ account. See [Cozy-stack documentation about aggregator accounts)[https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/blob/master/docs/konnectors-workflow.md#aggregator-accounts].

#### Example
```json
{
  "relationships": {
    "parent": {
      "_id": "aggregator-service-account",
      "_doctype": "io.cozy.accounts"
    }
  }
}
```

### About `login`

Some konnectors does not use a `login` parameter, but `identifier` or `email`. The usage of anything except `login` is deprecated and should not be done.

### Examples

#### Freemobile (regular connector, with current deprecation)
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "accountName": "freemobile",
    "credentials_encrypted": "aaDtwWSWsdpbbbbbbbbbbbbbbOzp2pBEbXlZLWjiTzOGumGRomrF2LwlRn4Y8c=",
    "folderPath": "/Administratif/Free Mobile",
    "login": "000000000",
    "namePath": "Free Mobile",
    "password": "*******"
  }
}
```
What we aim:
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "credentials_encrypted": "aaDtwWSWsdpbbbbbbbbbbbbbbOzp2pBEbXlZLWjiTzOGumGRomrF2LwlRn4Y8c=",
    "login": "000000000",
    "password": "**********"
  },
  "folderPath": "/Administratif/Free Mobile",
  "label": "freemobile",
  "namePath": "Free Mobile"
}
```

#### Caisse d'Ã‰pargne (Linxo connector)

The connectors based on Linxo API are storing specific informations into `data` attribute.

```json
{
  "account_type": "linxo",
  "auth": {
    "folderPath": null,
    "frequency": "week",
    "identifier": "0000000000",
    "secret": "*********"
  },
  "data": {
    "auth": {
      "login": "00000.00000000@cozyclaudy.red.cloud",
      "password": "********************************"
    },
    "status": "connected",
    "token": "f415e",
    "uuid": "deadbeef-912e-4ba8-9378-067c5c3e4f54"

  }
}
```
